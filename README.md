# IoWater
We aim develop free technologies to sensing and monitoring  water resources and water/wastewater treatment plants.

## Parameters to measure
* Turbidity
* pH
* Oxidation reduction potential (ORP)
* Chlorine
* Temperature
* Color
* Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
* Chemical oxygen demand (COD)

## Prototyping

### Primary Elements
### Transducers
#### Integration with industrial instrumentation instruments
### Microcontrollers
The microcontrollers utilized has free C compilers:
* Arduino (avr-gcc)
* MSP430 Launchpad (gcc-msp430)
### Communications Protocols
